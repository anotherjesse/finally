One part taboo, one part mini-mapper, one part flock shelf, one part scrap book, one part netvibes

The goal is to be extensible ala greasemonkey (easy to add scripts to enhance without restarting),
providing wrappers around the technologies that aren't "standard" (xbl/rdf/dnd) so that enhancements
can be done by as many people as possible.

TODO:

  * pattern for inheritance/reuse of xbls (lots of redundancy)
  * rdf is currently in memory - needs to be serialized
  * pattern for scraplets to determine DND content
